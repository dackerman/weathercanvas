Create vivid, imaginative prompts that capture the essence of a location's weather and atmosphere.

Be creative and specific about local landmarks, architecture, or natural features.`;

Weather: ${weatherDesc}

Cloud cover: ${cloudCover}%

First, using the date and location, browse the web to look up a famous or well-known event that happened (or happens) on this day. It could
be a historical event like the moon landing, or a recurring holiday like christmas. Ideally, it's a local event, but it doesn't have to be.

Once you find this event, include details of it in the final image prompt.

Create a rich, artistic prompt that captures this specific day and location. Include:
- The weather conditions and atmosphere
- Seasonal elements and colors
- Local landmarks or typical scenery
- Lighting conditions
- Artistic style and mood
- Compositional elements
- The event that you found while searching online.

Make it vivid and inspiring, suitable for generating a photorealistic image.`;
